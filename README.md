\# 📘 Java Learning Journey



This repository contains my practice files from when I started learning \*\*Java programming\*\*.  

I followed along with the \*\*CodeWithHarry Java Playlist\*\*, which helped me build a strong foundation in Java.



\## 📂 What’s Inside

\- Basic Java programs (syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, etc.)

\- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

\- Small practice exercises



\## 🙏 Special Thanks

A huge thanks to \*\*\[CodeWithHarry](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry)\*\* for his amazing work and  

his \*\*\[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry)\*\*, which made learning Java so much easier for me.  



His tutorials motivated me to keep practicing, and this repo is a reflection of that learning journey.
