\# 📘 Java Learning Journey



This repository contains my practice files from when I started learning \*\*Java programming\*\*.  

I followed along with the \*\*CodeWithHarry Java Playlist\*\*, which helped me build a strong foundation in Java.



\## 📂 What’s Inside

\- Basic Java programs (syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, etc.)

\- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

\- Small practice exercises



\## 🙏 Special Thanks

A huge thanks to \*\*\[CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry)\*\* for his amazing tutorials.  

His Java playlist made learning much easier and motivated me to keep practicing.
