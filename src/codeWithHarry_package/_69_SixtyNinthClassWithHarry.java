		 	Multi-processing and multi-threading both are used to achieve multi-tasking.
		 	
		 	In a nut-shell:
		 	-->Threads are used to shared memory area
		 	-->Threads are faster content switching
		 	-->A thread is light-weight whereas a process is heave-weight
		 	-->We do threading within in processing
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	# flow control in Java:
		 	1.Without threading:
		 	main-->func1()-->func2()-->end
		 	
		 	2. With threading:
		 	main()
		 	func1()    ----> end
		 	func2()
		 	
		 	
		 	#Creating a thread:
		 	There are two ways to create a thread in Java:
		 	1. By extending Thread class
		 	2. By implementing runnable interface
		 	
		 	Actually thread or multi-threading is used to do multi-tasking means parallel doing of many task.
		 	Which faster our program and reduce execution time of a program.
		 	It is used to achieve con-curruncy in program. 
		 	Note: Con-currency and parallelism is not same thing. There's a difference between them.
		 	
		 	Con-currency is the task of running and managing the multiple computations at the same time.
		 	While, parallelism is the task of running multiple computations simultaneously.
		 	Concurrency can be done by using a single processing unit.
